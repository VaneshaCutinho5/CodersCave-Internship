Phase 1 Assignments:

**Normal Task-**
1. Exploratory Data Analysis - Terrorism
The goal of this project is to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the terrorism dataset
to extract meaningful insights and patterns. By analyzing the dataset, we aim to uncover
trends, identify high-risk regions, understand attack characteristics, and potentially reveal
factors that contribute to terrorist activities.

2. Breast Cancer Prediction-
The objective of this project is to create a predictive model that can accurately classify breast
cancer cases as benign or malignant based on a set of relevant features. By leveraging
historical data and applying machine learning techniques, we aim to develop a reliable tool for
assisting medical professionals in diagnosing breast cancer.

 3. Email Spam Detection-
The goal of this project is to develop a robust email spam detection system using machine
learning techniques. By analyzing the content and characteristics of emails, the system should
be able to accurately classify incoming emails as either spam or legitimate (ham).

**Golden Task-**

4. Speech Emotion Recognition-
The objective of this project is to develop a robust speech emotion recognition system capable
of accurately classifying the emotional states conveyed in spoken language. By analyzing the
acoustic features of speech signals, the system should be able to categorize emotions such as
happiness, sadness, anger, fear, and more.
